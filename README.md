# Insights
This repository contains insights distilled from some popular research papers. Intention is to write about ideas from papers that may be helpful for an embedded systems software developer.

The idea first came to me after watching a video by Vivek Haldar's Youtube Channel where he reads a paper and discusses main ideas discussed in that paper.

Paper writing is a rigourous intellectual activity. A researcher spends tens of hundreds of hours honing arguments to best present her/his thoughts and ideas to others. An attempt to squeeze the information into some "quick/handy" bullet points can never do full justice to the depth of the material they discuss through their published paper.

While such a "quick/handy" bullet point list does not exist for all papers, it may be of use to programmers. My understanding is that the ideal audience of some papers is not research comunity but utlimately the programmer. Nothing would make a researcher happier than knowing that the idea he presented in a paper is being implemented by some programmer. It can take different forms:

1. A different process of software developemnt
2. A different way of naming the variables
3. A different way of sorting or searching
4. A new algorithm for cache replacement policy
5. A different way of efficient mallocing
6. A different way of thinking about object oriented design

A programmer will never know until she/he is introduced to these ideas. The problem is sprint deadlines and life in general does not allow a programmer to take out time from the day and read papers. I get that.

I am a firmware developer, and I develop in C, C++. I came up with a solution, basically to solve the above problem for myself because I rarely get time to read, but let's give this a try. I thought such a "quick/handy" bullet point list of ideas discussed in some popular papers can help me in learning about new ideas and consequently develop better intuition for software development while building my own reasoning and arguments.
