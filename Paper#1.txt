1. Applications pay huge performance penalties in using the abstractions provided by operating systems like UNIX and its variants.

2. High performance applications have to pay this penalty even though they might not be using these abstractions.

3. An "end to end" principle where the intelligent higher level logic lives near the application.

4. Separate protection from management.

5. Proposed exokernel that would export hardware resources like TLB, memory management etc to the library system for use by the application.

6. The exokernel would keep track of only ownership not management thus making it light.
